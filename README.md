# Riddle Game
Demo: http://py-game.herokuapp.com/

## Overview

> This logic-driven web application created in Python is a riddle game that will generate 10 riddles to be unraveled.

This game was created for people who enjoy to exercise their minds through challenges but also enjoy having some fun!

* Users are identified by a unique username (without authentication)
* To each correct answer 1 point is added, the next question is displayed and the score is printed on the screen 
* To each incorrect answer no point is added and the user can try it again
* The players have the choice to skip a question
* The result is displayed during the game and in the end
* Multiple users can play at the same time

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Python
* Flask

## Testing

The game's logic was tested manually by comparing the logic applied and the effect achieved

1. Choosing an username
- If the form is not filled out the game does not start. :heavy_check_mark:

2. Riddles
- Each time the user gives the correct answer the next riddle is loaded. :heavy_check_mark:

4. Skip riddle
- Every time the user skips the riddle, the next riddle is loaded. :heavy_check_mark:

3. Scoring
- Each time the user answers correctly, 1 point is added to the user's score. :heavy_check_mark:
- Each time the user answers incorrectly, the user does not get any point. :heavy_check_mark:
- The points are accumulated throughout the game. :heavy_check_mark:


The capability of having multiple players using the app at the same time in different browsers was also tested.
A user is able to use the back/forward button without breaking the site.
